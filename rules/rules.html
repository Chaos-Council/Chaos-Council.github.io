                <strong>No making people feel bad</strong>
                <p>Being positive should be a top priority for everybody. No one should be made fun of.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>No cursing too much</strong>
                <p>Cursing can hurt people's feelings, and that's not nice.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>No asking for personal information</strong>
                <p>Personal information is private. Asking for it can lead to serious problems.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Don't be negative in this server</strong>
                <p>This is similar to “No making people feel bad.” Just be kind and respectful.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Sign up properly and don't get mad if your application gets rejected</strong>
                <p>If we reject your application, it's not personal. It just means something didn’t meet the requirements. In the prof of read box in the form type "I have read the rules and will respect them"</p>
